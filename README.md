# Mr.Email

- So this is a little project of mine I did on python. It's job is to automate the process of sending emails to multiple senders. It is pretty useful when you have to send messages to the   same emails everytime. You can save the emails of people you want to send it to and then just run it. It will send the message to those emails automatically.
# Instructions:
  - ## Setup
    - ### Setup sender data
      - First, run the sender.py. Input the email of the sender in the <b>"Sender's email"</b> field.
      - Secondly, go to your google account. Then go to Security. Then search for <b>"App Passwords"</b>. There, create an app by giving an           <b>"App Name"</b>. You will then get           an <b>"App Password"</b>. Copy it, and input it in the <b>"Sender's Google App Password"</b>              field.
    - ### Setup receiver data
      - Run receivers.py. Input the number of receivers you will add in the <b>"Number_of_receivers"</b> field.
      - Then input the receivers' email in the <b>"Receiver's email"</b> field.
  - ## Sending Emails
      - Now all you have to do is just run email_sender.py. If you want to <b>add new receivers</b>, then run <b>receivers.py</b> and do              the process mentioned in the <b>Setup          receiver data</b> section of <b>Setup</b>. If you want to change the <b>sender</b>, then run           <b>sender.py</b> and do the process mentioned in the <b>Setup sender data</b>         section of <b>Setup</b>.
